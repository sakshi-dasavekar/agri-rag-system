Answer: Climate and SunAloe overwinters outdoors in US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 and 11 where average minimum temperatures stay above 30 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit In summer it tolerates lows from 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit and in winter it does not do well in temperatures under 40 degrees Fahrenheit Indoors it can tolerate dry air Aloe requires full sun for flowering but can adapt to partial shade in some areasSoilThis plant naturally occurs in extremely dry and poor soils It will grow well in many different types of soil from sandy to moderately fertile loam as long as it has good drainage To increase drainage at your planting site build a mound before planting the aloe incorporating organic compost into the soilWaterAs a succulent plant aloe requires very little water and does not respond well to overly wet soil It can tolerate drought but a small amount of water will do wonders for the plant In spring and summer soak the soil around the plant when watering

water and does not respond well to overly wet soil It can tolerate drought but a small amount of water will do wonders for the plant In spring and summer soak the soil around the plant when watering but allow it to dry completely before watering again During the winter months aloe uses less water so decrease the amount you give the plant to just moisten the soil instead of soaking itWinter ProtectionYou can bring potted plants indoors for the winter when overnight temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit Because aloe naturally retains a large amount of water it does not respond well to freezing and requires protection For outdoor plants when temperatures fall toward 32 degrees Fahrenheit drive stakes into the ground around the plant and drape a blanket over the stakes Secure the edges of the blanket with rocks or bricks This will help the aloe plant withstand light infrequent frosts   by Taboola Sponsored Links From The WebThis Gmail Tool Finds Anyones Email Address in 5

Question: DRYING METHOD OF GINGER

=== CHUNK 1214 ===
Answer: Drying GingerThe simplest way to dry ginger is to place it on a plate next to a window that gets a lot of sun for 3-4 days If you dont want to wait a few days place the ginger slices in a dehydrator or low oven no hotter than 150F Check your ginger every half hour or so Drying at 150F will take roughly 1 to 2 hours while the drying time in a dehydrator will depend on the heat setting If your oven doesnt go as low as 150F crack the oven door and put the oven rack on its lowest level Check your ginger every 15-20 minutes to make sure it doesnt burnOnce your ginger is dry remove it from the oven or dehydrator and let it cool After it has cooled check it again to be sure it is completely dry If it isnt pop it back into the oven or dehydrator for another round of heat It is important for the ginger to be completely dry before storing or grinding because any residual moisture could cause moldThe dried ginger slices are great for making ginger tea They store well in an airtight
