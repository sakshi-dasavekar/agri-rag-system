Question: HARVESTING QUANTITY OF MUSHROOM 
Answer: Harvesting mushrooms takes place in flushesThe first flush is picked in 3 to 5 days and yields 15 to 20 kgm2 If the mushrooms are mechanically harvest in the form of once-over harvesting this yields 22 to 26 kgm2The second flush comes after about 5-7 days and yields a little less 9-11 kgm2 for hand-harvesting 10-15 kgm2 for mechanical harvestingThe third flight at most yields 10-15 of production and is of lower quality because diseases and pests are increasing very strongly Depending on the economic situation a third flush is harvested It takes about 6 to 8 days before the third flush can be harvested During hand-picking the flush is harvested in 2 daysTotal production is between 27 and 35 kgm2 Hand-picking mushrooms can be stored and consumed fresh Mechanically harvested mushrooms are harvested in a once-over operation and directly processed and preserved

Question: PHASES: COMPOSTING SPAWNINGCASING  PINNING

=== CHUNK 3045 ===
Answer: Compost PreparationThe substrate for cultivation is specially prepared compost The mushroom houses should have the facilities for temperature control and pasteurization Buildings are constructed of wood or hollow cement bricks or double walls The shed is partitioned into small compartments and provided with trays Environmental conditions like temperature relative humidity and ventilation are controlled inside the shed by installing suitable equipmentCompost is the substrate in which the mushroom mycelium grows and on which it produces fruiting bodies It is the product of a fermentation process brought out by a number of mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms that decompose plant residues and other organic and inorganic matters The quality of compost influences the yield of mushroom Compost prepared out of horse manure and wheat straw is ideal one Since these materials are not easily available many substitutes are suggested and are in use There are two methods of composting

=== CHUNK 3046 ===
Compost prepared out of horse manure and wheat straw is ideal one Since these materials are not easily available many substitutes are suggested and are in use There are two methods of composting Long method and short method The distinction is based on the time taken for composting and the long method needs three to four weeks while the short method requires only 12-15 days since the composting process is hastened by pasteurization In the long method of composting pasteurization is avoided which will make the compost poor in quality and often gives variable yieldsIn a tunnel the indoor fresh compost is pasteurized at 57-60 degrees Celsius This kills all possible bacteria The compost stays in the tunnel to mature for six days after which the compost is mixed with spawn that will produce the mushrooms: the mycelium The compost is then moved to another tunnel where the mycelium can spread through the compost The mycelium grows quickly after two weeks it has completely permeated the

the mushrooms: the mycelium The compost is then moved to another tunnel where the mycelium can spread through the compost The mycelium grows quickly after two weeks it has completely permeated the compost which means that is has reached the point that it is ready for the growers At this time the compost looks like light brown peatMost mushroom growers do not produce their own spawn as it is a very sophisticated process Specialized companies produce the spawn by inoculating grain with spores The grain is sterilized first to prevent infection and its kept moist exactly the way mushrooms like it Ten kilo of spores 22 pounds provides about five hundred kilos of inoculated grain 1100 pounds The grain is incubated in a bag for two weeks at 25 degrees Celsius 75 degrees Fahrenheit then transferred to a refrigerator at 2 degrees Celsius 35 degrees Fahrenheit to harden it In this way the spawn gets a shelf life of 6 months without the mycelium losing its vitalityThe matured compost is spread

to a refrigerator at 2 degrees Celsius 35 degrees Fahrenheit to harden it In this way the spawn gets a shelf life of 6 months without the mycelium losing its vitalityThe matured compost is spread onto long stainless steel boxes the mushroom beds The beds are inside special dark rooms called cells The temperature in the cells is kept nice and warm at about 23 degrees Celsius A layer of peat casing material is added on top of the compost to keep the compost moist Over a period of six days 20 to 25 litres of water is sprinkled on each m2 in each cell because more moisture is needed After this the fungus has two days to grow through the covering layer of casing soilMushrooms only grow in the wild in autumn However they can be cultivated year round by recreating autumn conditions Therefore the temperature in the cell is gradually lowered from 23 to 17 degrees Celsius over four days The mushroom grower starts to lower the temperature once he sees that the mycelium has grown to its full

the temperature in the cell is gradually lowered from 23 to 17 degrees Celsius over four days The mushroom grower starts to lower the temperature once he sees that the mycelium has grown to its full extent The temperature shock is a sign for the mycelium to start sprouting the mushrooms The same thing happens in nature Mycelium grows well in mild autumn weather and after an October storm the mushrooms will start appearing The mycelium starts to form little buds which will develop into mushrooms Those little white buds are called pins In this phase air temperature and humidity can influence growth Low air temperature and low humidity produce more buds which yield smaller mushrooms Higher air temperature and humidity produce fewer but larger mushroomsfor training and input kindly visit Dept of agriculture

Answer: Phase I:1 Making Mushroom CompostThis phase of compost preparation usually occurs outdoors although an enclosed building or a structure with a roof over it may be used A concrete slab referred to as a wharf is required for composting In addition a compost turner to aerate and water the ingredients and a tractor-loader to move the ingredients to the turner is needed In earlier days piles were turned by hand using pitchforks which is still an alternative to mechanized equipment but it is labor intensive and physically demandingPhase I composting is initiated by mixing and wetting the ingredients as they are stacked in a rectangular pile with tight sides and a loose center Normally the bulk ingredients are put through a compost turner Water is sprayed onto the horse manure or synthetic compost as these materials move through the turner Nitrogen supplements and gypsum are spread over the top of the bulk ingredients and are thoroughly mixed by the turner Once the pile is wetted and

compost as these materials move through the turner Nitrogen supplements and gypsum are spread over the top of the bulk ingredients and are thoroughly mixed by the turner Once the pile is wetted and formed aerobic fermentation composting commences as a result of the growth and reproduction of microorganisms which occur naturally in the bulk ingredients Heat ammonia and carbon dioxide are released as by-products during this process Compost activators other than those mentioned are not needed although some organic farming books stress the need for an activatorMushroom compost develops as the chemical nature of the raw ingredients is converted by the activity of microorganisms heat and some heat-releasing chemical reactions These events result in a food source most suited for the growth of the mushroom to the exclusion of other fungi and bacteria There must be adequate moisture oxygen nitrogen and carbohydrates present throughout the process or else the process will stop This is why water

the potential yield and quality of a crop and is a significant step in the production cycleTOP6 CroppingThe terms flush break or bloom are names given to the repeating 3- to 5-day harvest periods during the cropping cycle these are followed by a few days when no mushrooms are available to harvest This cycle repeats itself in a rhythmic fashion and harvesting can go on as long as mushrooms continue to mature Most mushroom farmers harvest for 35 to 42 days although some harvest a crop for 60 days and harvest can go on for as long as 150 daysAir temperature during cropping should be held between 57 to 62F for good results This temperature range not only favors mushroom growth but cooler temperatures can lengthen the life cycles of both disease pathogens and insects pests It may seem odd that there are pests which can damage mushrooms but no crop is grown that does not have to compete with other organisms Mushroom pests can cause total crop failures and often the deciding factor on how

there are pests which can damage mushrooms but no crop is grown that does not have to compete with other organisms Mushroom pests can cause total crop failures and often the deciding factor on how long to harvest a crop is based on the level of pest infestation These pathogens and insects can be controlled by cultural practices coupled with the use of pesticides but it is most desirable to exclude these organisms from the growing roomsThe relative humidity in the growing rooms should be high enough to minimize the drying of casing but not so high as to cause the cap surfaces of developing mushrooms to be clammy or sticky Water is applied to the casing so water stress does not hinder the developing mushrooms in commercial practice this means watering 2 to 3 times each week Each watering may consist of more or fewer gallons depending on the dryness of the casing the cultivar being grown and the stage of development of the pins buttons or mushrooms Most first-time growers apply too much

temperature control in your home Heat can originate from hot water circulated through pipes mounted on the walls Hot forced air can be blown through a ventilation duct which is rather common at more recently built mushroom farms There are a few mushroom farms located in limestone caves where the rock acts as both a heating and cooling surface depending on the time of year Caves of any sort are not necessarily suited for mushroom growing and abandoned coal mines have too many intrinsic problems to be considered as viable sites for a mushroom farm Even limestone caves require extensive renovation and improvement before they are suitable for mushroom growing and only the growing occurs in the cave with composting taking place above ground on a wharfMushrooms are harvested in a 7- to 10-day cycle but this may be longer or shorter depending on the temperature humidity cultivar and the stage when they are picked When mature mushrooms are picked an inhibitor to mushroom development is

45F To prolong the shelf life of mushrooms it is important that mushrooms breathe after harvest so storage in a nonwaxed paper bag is preferred to a plastic bagAfter the last flush of mushrooms has been picked the growing room should be closed off and the room pasteurized with steam This final pasteurization is designed to destroy any pests which may be present in the crop or the woodwork in the growing room thus minimizing the likelihood of infesting the next cropTOPConclusionIt takes approximately 15 weeks to complete an entire production cycle from the start of composting to the final steaming off after harvesting has ended For this work a mushroom grower can expect anywhere from 0 to 4 lbs per square foot the national average for 1980 was 312 lbs per square foot Final yield depends on how well a grower has monitored and controlled the temperature humidity pests and so on All things considered the most important factors for good production appear to be experience plus an intuitive
